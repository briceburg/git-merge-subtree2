# v0.1.2 (SNAPSHOT)
- v0.1.1 introduced a bug, that resulted in push-merges not being considered
  when calculating the merge base (more precise: they have been considered only
  if "my-prefix" was equal to "their-prefix"). This issue is now resolved.
- When parsing their branch's history, the order of the marker arguments is not
  relevant any more. This might improve forward compatibility.

# v0.1.1 (2016-12-07)
- Multiple subprojects sharing the same combination of source/target-branch are
  now distinguished properly. Previously subprojects were mixed when push
  operations were involved.
  
# v0.1.0 (2016-11-29)
